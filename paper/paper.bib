  abstract = {Background and purpose - In-hospital death following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is related to comorbidity. The long-term effect of comorbidity on all-cause mortality is, however, unknown for this group of patients and it was investigated in this study. Patients and methods - We used data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, linked to the National Patient Register from the National Board of Health and Welfare, for patients operated on with THA in 1999-2012. We identified 120,836 THAs that could be included in the study. We evaluated the predictive power of the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices on mortality, using concordance indices calculated after 5, 8, and 14 years after THA. Results - All comorbidity indices performed poorly as predictors, in fact worse than a base model with age and sex only. Elixhauser was, however, the least bad choice and it predicted mortality with concordance indices 0.59, 0.58, and 0.56 for 5, 8, and 14 years after THA. Interpretation - Comorbidity indices are poor predictors of long-term mortality after THA.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2", 26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "??? 5", 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2", 48\% (25); " ??? 3", 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank ??2 = 165; p \textexclamdown{} 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small. ?? 1987.},

In the context of total hip replacement (THR), registers can help elucidate the relevant factors that affect the clinical outcome. We evaluated the evolution of factors related to patient, surgical procedure, socio-economy, and various outcome parameters after merging databases of the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data on 193,253 THRs (164,113 patients) operated between 1999 and 2012 were merged. We studied the evolution of surgical volume, patient demographics, socio-economic factors, surgical factors, length-of-stay, mortality rate, adverse events, re-operation and revision rates, and Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Throughout this time period the majority of patients were operated on with a diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis. Comorbidity indices increased each year observed. The share of all-cemented implants has dropped from 92\% to 68\%. More than 88\% of the bearings were metal-on-polyethylene. Length-of-stay decreased by 50\%. There was a reduction in 30- and 90-day mortality. Re-operation and revision rates at 2 years are decreasing. The post-operative PROMs improved despite the observation of worse pre-operative pain scores getting over time. The demographics of patients receiving a THR, their comorbidities, and their primary diagnosis are changing. Notwithstanding these changes, outcomes like mortality, re-operations, revisions, and PROMs have improved. The practice of hip arthroplasty has evolved, even in a country such as Sweden that is considered to be conservative with regard taking on new surgical practices. (c) 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {Most patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) have an uneventful and relatively pain-free future, whereas some patients will have further health-care encounters related to their hip joints. These contacts may be for revision of the ipsi-lateral hip. The hip might also be re-operated on for reasons not necessitating exchange or extraction of the implant or any of its parts. Some patients will need surgery on the opposite hip and may also undergo re-operation or revision surgery on the second hip. Better knowledge of patients' hip-related timeline (HRT) may improve the understanding and expecta-tions of patients, surgeons, and healthcare providers. Further healthcare contacts are important in the case of bundled pay-ments, tariffs, and payments-by-results (Burwell 2015, Jubelt et al. 2017). The increasing demands and fi nancial pressures on health systems make predictions of further contacts with healthcare providers important. Several studies have described the lifetime risk for revision and long-term mortality, but few have described the different paths (i.e., contralateral THA, revisions, and death) the patient can follow (Gillam et al. 2012, 2013, Abdel et al. 2016, Mara-dit Kremers et al. 2016, Sanders et al. 2017). The increased availability and quality of longitudinal data have stimulated the development of life-history models. Multi-state analysis has been advocated as a natural framework, studying transi-tions between different stages (Commenges 1999) and has been shown to provide a convenient framework for the han-dling of a wide variety of medical conditions, characterized by multiple events where longitudinal data are available (Fare-well and Tom 2014). This framework allows for the combining of several possible outcomes in a single analysis and aids the depiction of the hip-related timeline that patients potentially could follow. This is in contrast with the more classical},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Hip fractures are a common problem of the elderly population with significant mortality and morbidity. The choice between total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty depends on multiple factors including comorbidity. The Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register (SHAR) provides a unique opportunity to study mortality and revision rates in this population. Linkage with government databases allow for in-depth research into the factors that influence risk of revision surgery and death in the hip fracture patient. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data was linked between SHAR, Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data was collected on 38,912 patients who received a fracture-related hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012. A multistate analysis was performed and three states were identified: primary hip surgery and alive (state 1), revision after primary hip surgery (state 2) and death (state 3). These were marking points in the longitudinal outcome study. RESULTS 38,912 patients who received an arthroplasty for an acute hip fracture were included. By the end of the study period 1309 (3.4\%) of these patients underwent a revision and 17,365 (45.1\%) patients died. Patients with THA had a reduced risk of death from primary operation compared to hemiarthroplasty (HR = 0.49) and a decreased revision risk (HR = 0.69). Female patients had a statistically significant reduced mortality (HR = 0.6) compared to men. There was no statistically significant difference in risk of revision surgery between direct lateral and posterior approach. CONCLUSION We identified an influence of type of surgery, sex, age and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) on risk of revision and mortality. Males, greater comorbidity burden and older patients had higher mortality risks. The posterior approach did not have a significant influence on revision risk. Further research could include all patients who had reoperation(s) to further strengthen our findings. Patients who had a THA had lower revision rate and mortality. The latter is likely due to selection.},

Design The 46 comorbidities in the Rx-Risk Index were mapped to dispensing's indicative of each condition using ATC codes. Prescription dispensing claims in 2014 were used to calculate the Rx-Risk. A baseline logistic regression model was fitted using age and gender as covariates. Rx-Risk was added to the base model as an (1) unweighted score, (2) weighted score and as (3) individual comorbidity categories indicating the presence or absence of each condition. The Akaike information criterion and c-statistic were used to compare the models. Setting Models were developed in the Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs health claims data, and external validation was undertaken in a 10\% sample of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Data. Participants Subjects aged 65 years or older. Outcome measures Death within 1 year (eg, 2015). Results Compared with the base model (c-statistic 0.738, 95\% CI 0.734 to 0.742), including Rx-Risk improved prediction of mortality; unweighted score 0.751, 95\% CI 0.747 to 0.754, weighted score 0.786, 95\% CI 0.782 to 0.789 and individual comorbidities 0.791, 95\% CI 0.788 to 0.795.

Conclusions The updated Rx-Risk Comorbidity Score was predictive of 1-year mortality and may be useful in practice to adjust for confounding in observational studies using medication claims data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms. METHODS: ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms. RESULTS: Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM comorbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Assessment of disease burden is the key to many aspects of health care management. Patient diagnoses are commonly used for case-mix assessment. However, issues pertaining to diagnostic data availability and reliability make pharmacy-based strategies attractive. Our goal was to provide a reliable and valid pharmacy-based case-mix classification system for chronic diseases found in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) population. OBJECTIVE To detail the development and category definitions of a VA-adapted version of the RxRisk (formerly the Chronic Disease Score); to describe category prevalence and reliability; to check category criterion validity against ICD-9 diagnoses; and to assess category-specific regression coefficients in concurrent and prospective cost models. RESEARCH DESIGN Clinical and pharmacological review followed by cohort analysis of diagnostic, pharmacy, and utilization databases. SUBJECTS 126,075 veteran users of VHA services in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska. METHODS We used Kappa statistics to evaluate RxRisk category reliability and criterion validity, and multivariate regression to estimate concurrent and prospective cost models. RESULTS The RxRisk-V classified 70.5\% of the VHA Northwest Network 1998 users into an average of 2.61 categories. Of the 45 classes, 33 classes had good-excellent 1-year reliability and 25 classes had good-excellent criterion validity against ICD-9 diagnoses. The RxRisk-V accounts for a distinct proportion of the variance in concurrent (R2 = 0.18) and prospective cost (R2 = 0.10) models. CONCLUSIONS The RxRisk-V provides a reliable and valid method for administrators to describe and understand better chronic disease burden of their treated populations. Tailoring to the VHA permits assessment of disease burden specific to this population.},
