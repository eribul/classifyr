## Aim of the package

The goal of `{coder}` is to classify items from one dataset, using codes
from a secondary source with classification schemes based on regular
expressions and weighted indices.

## Installation

You can (soon) install the released version of coder from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("coder") # Not yet!
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("eribul/coder")
```

## Typical use case

  - Determining comorbidities before clinical trials
  - Discovering adverse events after surgery

**Patient data:** The initial rationale for the package was to classify
patient data based on medical coding. A typical use case would consider
patients from a medical/administrative data base, as identified by some
patient id and possibly with some associated date of interest (date of
diagnoses/treatment/intervention/hospitalization/rehabilitation). This
data source could be for example an administrative hospital register or
a national quality register.

**Codify:** The primary source could then be linked to a secondary
(possibly larger) data base including the same patients with
corresponding id:s and some coded patient data. This could be a national
patient register with medical codes from the International
Classification of Diseases *(ICD)* with corresponding dates of hospital
visits/admission/discharge, or a medical prescription register with
codes from the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical *(ATC)* classification
system with dates of medical prescription/dispatch/usage. A time window
could be specified relating the date of the primary source (i. e. the
date of a primary total hip arthroplasty; THA), to dates from the
secondary source (i.e.Â the date of a medical prescription). ATC codes
associated with medical prescriptions during one year prior to THA,
could thus be identified and used as a measure of comorbidity. Another
time window of 90 days after THA, might instead be used to identify
adverse events after surgery.

**Classify:** To work with medical/chemical codes directly might be
cumbersome, since those classifications tend to be massive and therefore
hard to interpret. It is thus common to use data aggregation as proposed
by some classification or combined index from the literature. This could
be the *Charlson* or *Elixhauser* comorbidity indices based on
ICD-codes, or the *RxRisk V* classification based on ATC-codes. Each of
those tools appear with different code versions (ICD-8, ICD-9, ICD-9-CM,
ICD-10, ICD-10-CA, ICD-10-SE, ICD-10-CM et cetera) and with different
codes recognized as relevant comorbidities (the Charlson index proposed
by Charlson et al, Deyo et al, Romano et al.Â Quan et al.Â et cetera).
Using a third object (in addition to the primary and secondary patient
data sets) helps to formalize and structure the use of such
classifications. This is implemented in the `coder` package by
`classcodes` objects based on regular expressions (often with several
alternative versions). Those `classcodes` objects could be prepared by
the user, although a number of default `classcodes` are also included in
the package (table below).

**Index:** Now, instead of working with tens of thousands of individual
ICD-codes, each patient might be recognized to have none or some
familiar comorbidity such as hypertension, cancer or dementia. This
granularity might be too fine-grained still, wherefore an even simpler
index score might be searched for. Such scores/indices/weighted sums
have been proposed as well and exist in many versions for each of the
standard classifications. Some are simple counts, some are weighted
sums, and some accounts for some inherited hierarchy (such that
ICD-codes for diabetes with and without complications might be
recognized in the same patient, although the un-complicated version
might be masked by the complicated version in the index).

**Conditions:** Some further complexity might appear if some codes are
only supposed to be recognized based on certain conditions. Patients
with THA for example might have an adverse event after surgery if a
certain ICD-code is recorded as the main diagnose at a later hospital
visit, although the same code could be ignored if recorded only as a
secondary diagnosis.

**To summarize:** The coder package takes three objects: (1) a data
frame/table/tibble with id and possible dates from a primary source; (2)
coded data from a secondary source with the same id and possibly
different dates and; (3) a `classcodes` object, either a default one
from the package, or as specified by the user. The outcome is then: (i)
codes associated with each element from (1) identified from (2),
possibly limited to a relevant time window; (ii) a broader
categorization of the relevant codes as prescribed by (3), and; (iii) a
summarized index score based on the relevant categories from (3).

(i-iii) corresponds to the output from functions `codify()`,
`classify()` and `index()`, which could be chained explicitly as
`codify() %>% classify() %>% index()`, or implicitly by the
`categorize()` function.

## Usage

Assume we have some patients with surgery at specified dates:

``` r
library(coder)
ex_people

```

Those patients (among others) were also recorded in a national patient
register with date of hospital admissions and diagnoses codes coded by
the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10:

``` r
ex_icd10
#> [90m# A tibble: 2,376 x 4[39m

#> [90m# â€¦ with 2,366 more rows[39m
```

Using those two data sets, as well as a classification scheme
(`classcodes` object; see below), we can easily identify all Charlson
comorbidities for each patient:

``` r
ch <- 
  categorize(
    ex_people,                  # patients of interest 
    codedata = ex_icd10,        # Medical codes from national patient register
    cc = "charlson",            # Calculate Charlson comorbidity
    id = "name", code = "icd10" # Specify column names
  )
#> Classification based on: icd10

```

How many patients were diagnosed with malignancy?

``` r
sum(ch$malignancy)
#> [1] 5
```

What is the distribution of the combined comorbidity index for each
patient?

``` r
barplot(table(ch$charlson))
```

<img src="man/figures/READMEunnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="100%" />

There are many versions of the Charlson comorbidity index, which might
be controlled by the `index` argument. We might also be interested only
in diagnoses from 90 days before surgery as specified with an argument
list `codify_args`as passed to `codify()`:

``` r
ch <- 
  categorize(
    ex_people, codedata = ex_icd10, cc = "charlson", id = "name", code = "icd10",
    
    # Additional arguments
    index       = c("quan_original", "quan_updated"), # Indices
    codify_args = list(
      date      = "surgery",   # Name of column with index dates
      code_date = "admission", # Name of column with code dates
      days      = c(-90, -1)   # Time window
    )
  )
#> Classification based on: icd10
```

Number of malignancies during this period?

``` r
sum(ch$malignancy, na.rm = TRUE)
#> [1] 3
```

Distribution of the index as proposed by Quan et al 2011 during the 90
day period:

``` r
barplot(table(ch$quan_updated))
```

<img src="man/figures/READMEunnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="100%" />

## Classification schemes

Classification schemes (`classcodes` objects, see
`vignette("classcodes")`) are based on regular expressions for
computational speed (see `vignette("Interpret_regular_expressions")`),
but their content can be summarized and visualized for clarity.
Arbitrary `classcodes` objects can also be specified by the user.

The package includes default `classcodes` for medical patient data based
on the international classification of diseases version 8, 9 and 10
(ICD-8/9/10), as well as the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
Classification System (ATC) for medical prescription data.

Default `classcades` are listed in the table. Each classification
(classcodes column) can be based on several code systems (regex column)
and have several alternative weighted indices (indices column). Those
might be combined freely.

``` r
coder::all_classcodes()
#> [90m# A tibble: 7 x 3[39m

# Relation to other packages

`coder` uses `data.table` as a backend to increase computational speed
for large datasets. There are some R packages with a narrow focus on
Charlson and Elixhauser co-morbidity based on ICD-codes
([icd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=icd),
[comorbidity](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=comorbidity),
[medicalrisk](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medicalrisk),
[comorbidities.icd10](https://github.com/gforge/comorbidities.icd10),
[icdcoder](https://github.com/wtcooper/icdcoder)). The `coder` package
includes similar functionalities but has a wider scope.
